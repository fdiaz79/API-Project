Some cool GIFS of Rock bands


How to use:

First crate the band button generator on th Button Creator Panel by inputing the name of the band, the amount of gifs you want to display and then hit the Add Button. You'll notice a new button qith the name of the band you wanted appeared in the GIFS Generator Panel.

Once the button has been generated, click on it and then enjoy your gifs in the GIF Viewer, in the lower part of your browser.

If at some point you forget how many gifs each button will generate, just hover over the desired button, a friendly message will appear with the information.

If you mistakenly added a button, you want to change it or you just want to delete it, activate the option by sliding the switch in the Button Creator Panel to the ON position and then click the button you wanted to delete. Remember to slide back the switch to the OFF position.
